ChrisCo — Data Visualization Project

This repository demonstrates applied data visualization techniques on the ChrisCo venue dataset(N.B. ChrisCo is a fictional company). It showcases data compilation, exploratory data analysis, interactive visualisations, and a concise final report designed for business stakeholders. The goal is to reveal trends, seasonality, anomalies, and to propose a volume-based segmentation of venues.

 Highlights
- Data compilation pipeline, cleaning and merging data from various sources. 
- Eight curated visualisations (including 2 interactive screenshots) that communicate findings to non-technical stakeholders.
- A final PDF report summarising methodology and results.

 Repo layout
- `notebooks/` — reproducible notebooks (data compile → EDA → interactive viz).
- `report/` — final PDF with cropped screenshots of the 8 visualisations.
- `data/` — (includes sample data).

 Run locally
See `notebooks/` for step-by-step execution. In short:
1. `git clone ...`
2. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. `jupyter notebook`

## Takeaway
This project demonstrates practical data visualization skills: cleaning and merging time-series data, detecting seasonality and anomalies, building interactive charts, and crafting a business-oriented report that non-technical readers can follow.
